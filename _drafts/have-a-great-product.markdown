> **How do I find new customers?**

This is a question the keeps business owners (including myself) up late night.  Because this is the type of questions that if it goes unanswered is what sinks a business. 

It's simple really, if you don't have customers t pay for your good or services, then you don't have a business. You can have an amazing brand, perfectly aligned with your target market, with the right messaging and marketing assets, but if you don't find new customers every day... You die.

Which is what marketing is supposed to be for right? But the reality is that most marketing... doesn't work. Now before you get uptight and start telling me that it most certainly works, bear in mind I am marketer, so obviously I believe that marketing works. The problem is that most marketing is incredibly ineffective. There are so many variables that go into each channel you can use to bring in customers, and so many external factors, that even the top experts of any given field can't guarantee success (just ask any SEO Guru). There are assumptions, case studies, and methodologies that make success more likely, but you don't know how the market is going to receive your campaign until you run it, and you can't run it without money. 

The most frustrating part is that you can't truly test any one channel without a decent chunk of cash. I always cringe when I hear someone tell me that they need at least 3 months of "testing" budget to really get it to work. Even though this makes sense statistically, the underlying message is basically "I have no idea if this is going to work, so I need 3 months to waste your money, learn how to do this for you and then hopefully at that point we will be able to get some results". As someone who runs these sorts of campaigns for people, knowing the that this is the simply reality, stresses me to the point of hair pulling. Because money is not free, every dollar spent on marketing is not spent paying employee's, rent, groceries, or even yourself (but seriously... who gets paid when they own a business?). Even if your business happens to be cash flush, and has marketing budgets set-aside, someones job is on the line, based on the success of the dollars they invest.

Yes, as an agency or consultancy, we take on risk. We have the risk of future business, which is really us solving our own "How do I get new customers" issues, but we aren't playing with our money. We aren't taking the risk.

So, do you work with Agencies that take on the risk? Work on a commission basis? Well we can speak from experience that these agencies won't last long. Because they don't control the product, it becomes too difficult for them to assume the risk because they don't own the product and have to work off of the previous companies assumptions.

SO WHAT DO YOU DO?
------------------

I've searched and searched for this answer, and every-time that I do, I end up back to this this:

**Have a flipping awesome product (or service) that is worth every penny people pay for it!**

Want an example of what I mean? Of course you do:

I spend $45 to get my hair cut. I understand that if you are a lady you are probably thinking "WHAT!! THAT'S IT??", but for a guy's cut, this is pretty expensive. But I have never felt that the price was too high and heres why
