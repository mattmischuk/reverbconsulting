Failure is a hard thing to talk about. No consultant can really ever admit to it without it hurting his credibility, and most people are incredibly ashamed to talk about it at all.

I know I am...

But it does strike me as odd that this is the case, as it is usually failure that teaches us the most in life. This applies both personally and professionally. Because if we don't fail, we won't learn how to succeed, or how to make something better. 

I could go on and on with examples, but I don't think that anybody reading this needs much convincing of the truth of that. Because, it's not that we don't understand failure, or the benefits that come from it, its that we hate the pain associated with it. 

Some people in this world are lucky, and they are able to handle failure with ease. They can see a situation and go "hmmm, well I will do that different next time." and move on with their life... Lots of us though feel the shame, the embarrassment, the feeling that sits in pit of your stomach and burns away at you, keeping you up at night that comes with failure. 

**I know I do...**

Recently there has been some great articles written on dealing with failure, and how to change your outlook on it, and I think those are good. They are helpful to provide prospective on how to adjust your mindset to better help you with success. However, I don't always see that line of thinking play out in reality. 

We are all different personalities. We feel things differently. We see the world through different lenses. To say that we just need to adjust out mindsets is almost like telling someone to change who they are. As sure as it is that we need to overcome the strangle hold that fear of failure can have on letting us start something new. We need to wary of anytime someone says that they aren't scared to fail. Because without fear of failure, how to do you care about success?

Yes, being able to overcome the fear of failure is valuable to help people get started in life, to help them take that first step, to "jump".

**But... **

that same fear of failure is what keeps us alive. It's what allows us to dig deep within ourselves and find what little strength we have left to push through the next day. Fear of failure gives us grit. The grit needed to fight for every last inch to get to success. 

If you aren't scared to fail, that means that success if just a nice bonus, if you don't happen to fail. If there is no fear of downside, then how can their be major commitment to upside? There can't be. It's simple logic: If you are not scared of the consequences, then you don't have a reason to give something everything you've got.
