Failure is a hard thing to talk about. No consultant can really ever admit to it without it killing their credibility, since we are the ones that are to prevent others from failure. Not to mention that in general the general public  ashamed to talk about it at all.

I know I am...

But it does strike me as odd that this is the case, as it is (usually) failure  that is life greatest teacher. This principal applies both personally and professionally. Because, if we don't fail, we won't can't know how to succeed or improve. 

I could go on and on with examples, but I don't think that anybody reading this needs much convincing. Besides, it's not that we don't understand the value of failure, and the benefits that come from it, its that we hate the pain associated with it. As humans we can hang on to that pain and let it rule us.

Now, this is not always the case. There are some people in this world who are lucky, and they are able to handle failure with ease. They can see a situation where they failed and simply think "I will do that different next time." before moving on with their life... However, lots of us can't do that. We feel the shame, the embarrassment, and the pain. We experience the hurt that sits in pit of your stomach and burns away at you, keeping you up at night and robbing you of joy. 

**I know I do...**

But we try our best to over come that. We read self help books, and news articles written by fantastic writers. Recently there has been some great articles written on dealing with failure, and how to change your outlook on it, and I think those are good. Those writings are helpful to provide prospective on how to adjust your mindset to better help you with success. 

However, I don't always see that line of thinking play out in reality. 

We are humans, we are unique and all have different personalities. We feel and experience things differently. To say that we just need to adjust our mindsets is almost like telling us to change who we are. Reading the top ten steps on how to change your mind and better deal with fear, makes it about as easy as telling someone ten top tips to losing weight. It goes deeper then that. To try to overcome that fear requires us to dig deep into who we are and work to change that.

Which, if its going to be that much effort, begs the question: Why?

As true as it is that we need to overcome the strangle hold that fear of failure can have on letting us start something new, or take a risk in life. We need to wary of anytime someone says we need to eliminate our fear of failure completely.

**Because...**

We need that fear of failure. It's that same fear of failure that keeps us alive. It's what allows us to dig deep within ourselves and find what little strength we have left to push through the next day.

Fear of failure gives us grit. The grit needed to fight for every last inch.

Which is what has always bothered me about the rhetoric surrounding failure and the tech culture who have been known to embrace failure. Not that there isn't incredible value in embracing failure as part of the game, because there is. However there is also incredible danger in not understanding the difference between the accepting of failure as an outcome, and losing the fear of it.

If you aren't scared to fail, then you are not fighting to succeed. Which translates to: success is a nice bonus, if you don't happen to fail. 

If there is no fear of downside, then how can their be major commitment to upside? There can't be. It's simple logic: If you are not scared of the consequences, then you don't have a reason to give something everything you've got.

Think about it this way. If you hire an agency or consultancy to work for you, you want them to be scared of failure. You want failure to keep them up at night. You want them to dread it, because it means that they are going to do everything in their power to find success for you. You don't want someone to say "We are risk takers who aren't afraid to fail!".

Because that's why you hire them. To help stop you from failing by lending their expertise. As a way to mitigate risk. To buffer the blame you apply to your self.

If they couldn't do it, and they are the experts, then obviously I couldn't have done it. It must have been a lost cause that I happened to get sucked into.

But the reality is that even the experts fail: I fail. Often.
